____________________________________


Being at **BeCode** I want to achieve the objectives that I've set earlier and work in a friendly creative network of passionates. The best way to reach our goals and wider projects is by a working as a team, so we need as much to *communicate* about the issues we face as we have to *support each other*, *being open-minded*, *solution oriented* and *assertive* while **being funny** !
